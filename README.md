Reviewer Comments:Code ran perfectly, Prompts were easy to follow, making it easy and fun to follow. I would add some kid of intro to the program instead of just starting of asking for inputs. Maybe start off with the title of the madlib and or telling the user that you are going to make a a madlib together. Other then that great job!
